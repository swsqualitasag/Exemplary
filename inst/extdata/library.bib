abstract = {A matrix derivation is proposed to analytically calculate the asymptotic genetic variance-covariance matrix under BLUP selection according to the initial genetic parameters in a large population with discrete generations. The asymptotic genetic evolution of a homogeneous population with discrete generations is calculated for a selection operating on an index including all information (pedigree and records) from a non-inbred and unselected base population (BLUP selection) or on an index restricted to records of a few ancestral generations. Under the first hypothesis, the prediction error variance of the selection index is independent of selection and is calculated from the genetic parameters of the base population. Under the second hypothesis, the prediction error variance depends on selection. Furthermore, records of several generations of ancestors of the candidates for selection must be used to maintain a constant prediction error variance over time. The number of ancestral generations needed depends on the population structure and on the occurrence of fixed effects. Without fixed effects to estimate, accounting for two generations of ancestors is sufficient to estimate the asymptotic prediction error variance. The amassing of information from an unselected base population proves to be important in order not to overestimate the asymptotic genetic gains and not to underestimate the asymptotic genetic variances.},

abstract = {Selection index theory was used to compare different selection strategies aiming at the improvement of meat quality in beef cattle. Alternative strategies were compared with a reference scenario with three basic traits in the selection index: BW at 200 d (W200) and 400 d (W400) and muscling score (MUSC). These traits resemble the combination currently used in the German national beef genetic evaluation system. Traits in the breeding goal were defi ned as the 3 basic traits plus marbling score (MARB), to depict a situation where an established breeding program currently selecting for growth and carcass yield intends to incorporate meat quality in its selection program. Economic weights were either the same for all 4 traits, or doubled or tripled for MARB. Two additional selection criteria for improving MARB were considered: Live animal intramuscular fat content measured by ultrasound (UIMF) as an indicator trait and a genomic breeding value (GEBV) for the target trait directly (gMARB). Results were used to estimate the required number of genotyped animals in an own calibration set for implementing genomic selection focusing on meat quality. Adding UIMF to the basic index increased the overall genetic gain per generation by 15{\%} when the economic weight on MARB was doubled and by 44{\%} when it was tripled. When a genomic breeding value for marbling could be estimated with an accuracy of 0.5, adding gMARB to the index provided larger genetic gain than adding UIMF. Greatest genetic gain per generation was obtained with the scenario containing GEBV for 4 traits (gW200, gW400, gMUSC, and gMARB) when the accuracies of these GEBV were ≥0.7. Adding UIMF to the index substantially improved response to selection for MARB, which switched from negative to positive when the economic weight on MARB was doubled or tripled. For all scenarios that contained gMARB in the selection index, the response to selection in MARB was positive for all relative economic weights on MARB, when the accuracy of GEBV was {\textgreater}0.7. Results indicated that setting up a calibration set of {\~{}}500 genotyped animals with carcass phenotypes for MARB could suffi ce to obtain a larger response to selection than measuring UIMF. If the size of the calibration set is {\~{}}2,500, adding the ultrasound trait to an index containing already the GEBV would bring little benefi t, unless the relative economic weight for marbling is much larger than for the other traits.},

abstract = {The first objective of this study was to test the ability of systems of weighing and classifying bovine carcasses used in commercial abattoirs in Ireland to provide information that can be used for the purposes of genetic evaluation of carcass weight, carcass fatness class, and carcass conformation class. Secondly, the study aimed to test whether genetic and phenotypic variances differed by breed of sire. Variance components for carcass traits were estimated for crosses between dairy cows and 8 breeds of sire commonly found in the Irish cattle population. These 8 breeds were Aberdeen Angus, Belgian Blue, Charolais, Friesian, Hereford, Holstein, Limousin, and Simmental. A multivariate animal model was used to estimate genetic parameters within the Holstein sire breed group. Univariate analyses were used to estimate variance components for the remaining 7 sire breed groups. Multivariate sire models were used to formally test differences in genetic variances in sire breed groups. Field data on 64,443 animals, which were slaughtered in commercial abattoirs between the ages of 300 and 875 d, were analyzed in 8 analyses. Carcass fat class and carcass conformation class were measured using the European Union beef carcass classification system (EUROP) scale. For all 3 traits, the sire breed group with the greatest genetic variance had a value of more than 8 times the sire breed group with least genetic variance. Heritabilities ranged from zero to moderate for carcass fatness class (0.00 to 0.40), from low to moderate for carcass conformation class (0.04 to 0.36), and from low to high for carcass weight (0.06 to 0.65). Carcass weight was the most heritable (0.26) of the 3 traits. Carcass conformation class and carcass fatness class were equally heritable (0.17). Genetic and phenotypic correlations were all positive in the Holstein sire breed group. The genetic correlations varied from 0.11 for the relationship between carcass weight and carcass fatness class to 0.44 for the relationship between carcass conformation class and carcass fatness class. Carcass weight and classification data collected in Irish abattoirs are useful for the purposes of genetic evaluation for beef traits of Irish cattle. There were significantly different variance components across the sire breed groups.},

abstract = {A deterministic bio-economic model was developed to estimate marginal economic values for production and functional traits for intensive (Continental) and extensive (British) breed groups in their typical production systems, and to estimate the relative importance of these two groups of traits. The model simulates the economic result of one purebred beef suckler cow and her progeny of each breed group on the basis of their lifetime production. The level of performance of the cow and progeny was set to the population means of traits in the respective breed group. Relative economic values (REV, in percentage) were estimated for 14 traits, seven production and seven functional traits. The REV for the intensive and extensive breed groups, respectively, were: herd life of cow; 39 and 29{\%}, age at first calving; 6 and 4{\%}, calving interval; 4 and 3{\%}, calving difficulty; 2 and 3{\%}, carcass weight; 24 and 29{\%}, carcass conformation; 5 and 5{\%}, carcass fatness; 2 and 5{\%}, growth rate from birth to 200. days; 4 and 6{\%}, growth rate from 200. days to 365. days; 6 and 9{\%} and growth rate from 365. days to slaughter; 7 and 7{\%}. The value of stillbirth, twinning frequency, limb and claw disorders and birth weight were all close to zero in both breed groups. Functional traits were almost as important as the production traits for both breed groups; however, functional traits were even more important for the intensive breed group (51 vs. 39{\%}). The results suggest that functional traits are important traits to include, regardless of breed, when developing breeding objectives for beef cattle, and should to a much larger extent than at present, be recorded in breeding schemes for beef cattle. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Milk yield has a strong effect on fertility, but it may vary across different herds and individual cows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of breed and its interaction with level of milk production at the herd level (Herd-L) and at a cow-within-herd level (Cow-L) on fertility traits in dairy cattle. Data were gathered from Holstein (n = 17,688), Brown Swiss (n = 32,697), Simmental (n = 27,791), and Alpine Grey (n = 13,689) cows in northeastern Italy. The analysis was based on records from the first 3 lactations in the years 2011 to 2014. A mixed model was fitted to establish milk production levels of the various herds (Herd-L) and individual cows (Cow-L) using milk as a response variable. The interval fertility traits were interval from calving to first service, interval from first service to conception, and number of days open. The success traits were nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service, pregnancy rate at first service, and the number of inseminations. The interval from calving to first service, interval from first service to conception, and number of days open were analyzed using a Cox's proportional hazards model. The nonreturn rate at 56 d after first service, pregnancy rate at first service, and the number of inseminations were analyzed using logistic regression. There was a strong interaction between breed and productivity class at both Herd-L and Cow-L on all traits. The effects of herd and cow productivity differed from each other and differed among breeds. The dual-purpose Simmental and Alpine Grey breeds had better fertility than the specialized Holstein and Brown Swiss dairy cows; this difference is only partly attributable to different milk yields. Greater herd productivity can result in higher fertility in cows, whereas higher milk yield of individual cows within a herd results in lower fertility. These effects at both Herd-L and Cow-L are curvilinear and are stronger in dual-purpose breeds, which was more evident from low to intermediate milk yield levels than from central to high productivity classes. Disentangling the effects of milk productivity on fertility at Herd-L and Cow-L and taking the nonlinearity of response into account could lead to better modeling of populations within breed. It could also help with management—for example, in precision dairy farming of dairy and dual-purpose cattle. Moreover, assessing the fertility of various breeds and their different responses to herd and individual productivity levels could be useful in devising more profitable crossbreeding programs in different dairy systems.},

abstract = {In the previous lecture we discussed breeding objectives and the derivation of the relative economic value of traits. In this lecture we consider the genetic change of multiple traits in more detail. -How to derive selection criteria for multiple traits -How to predict multiple trait selection response -How to manipulate multiple trait selection response -Considerations in order to make optimal genetic change 2.1 Introduction Improvement of efficiency and quality of animal production can be achieved by improving several characteristics simultaneously. For example, we may want to breed the ideal dairy cow that produces not only a lot of milk, but also with a high percentage of components like fat and especially protein. In addition, such high producing animals should preferably have no fertility problems, not suffer from diseases, and have a high roughage intake capacity. We would like pigs that grow fast but do not become too fat, with no leg problems and producing many piglets per litter. In beef cattle we want fast growing animals, but we don't want a too large mature size. We would like merino sheep with very fine wool, yet yielding a lot of it. Questions to be addressed: -Is it possible to change animals in any direction we want, and, can different characters be improved simultaneously? -How does change for each trait depend on economic weights, on correlations and heritabilities -how can we predict response to multiple trait selection? -how can we manipulate change in the construction of selection criteria (indexes)? -What is the most desirable change and how can we achieve this change? Genetic change takes place through selection. Selection criteria can be derived from information on animals' phenotypes and their relatives. Phenotypic information is generally based on objective measurement of animals' characteristics, but it can also include subjective scoring. Even genotype information about DNA-markers can be put in this category as it contributes to predicting an animals breeding value. Figure 2.1 puts this all in perspective. Information on phenotypes combined with pedigree information allows estimation of BLUP EBV on all animals for all traits. Breeding values can be combined in selection criteria (often a ' selection index') by using the economic weights. Then selection decisions are based on selection criteria, but not necessarily by truncation selection on index values, as we want to keep some genetic diversity. T hat's why pedigree information comes in again.},

abstract = {Single-step genomic prediction models utilizing both genotyped and nongenotyped animals are likely to become the prevailing tool in genetic evaluations of livestock. Various single-step prediction models have been proposed, based either on estimation of individual marker effects or on direct prediction via a genomic relationship matrix. In this study, a classical pedigree-based animal model, a regular single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) model, algorithm for proven and young (APY) with 2 strategies for choosing core animals, and a single-step Bayesian regression (ssBR) model were compared for 305-d production traits (milk, fat, protein) in the Finnish red dairy cattle population. A residual polygenic effect with 10{\%} of total genetic variance was included in the single-step models to reduce inflation of genomic predictions. Validation reliability was calculated as the squared Pearson correlation coefficient between genomically enhanced breeding value (GEBV) and yield deviation for masked records for 2,056 validation cows from the last year in the data set investigated. The results showed that gains of 0.02 to 0.04 on validation reliability were achieved by using single-step methods compared with the classical animal model. The regular ssGBLUP model and ssBR model with an extra polygenic effect yielded the same results. The APY methods yielded similar reliabilities as the regular ssGBLUP and ssBR. Exact prediction error variance of GEBV could be obtained by ssBR to avoid any approximation methods used for ssGBLUP when inversion left-hand side of mixed model equations is computationally infeasible for large data sets.},

abstract = {Consumer demand in relation to food is shifting towards products that are safe, nutritious, and of good eating quality. Beef consumers are demanding for experience quality that matches their expectations, particularly with respect to beef tenderness. The development of a beef quality grading and guarantee system obtained through muscle profiling research, can allow the beef industry to meet these demands. A qualitative consumer study has been carried out with beef consumers in France, Spain, United Kingdom and Germany to assess their opinions about beef muscle profiling and their interest in a beef eating-quality guarantee. Findings indicate that both concepts are well accepted by European beef consumers, although not unconditional. Participants express some reserve related to the possible upgrading of lower value cuts, too much standardisation, and the fact that tenderness is to some extent subjective. They further require the system to be simple, sufficiently documented and independent-party controlled. This study indicates good opportunities for the development of a beef eating-quality guarantee system in Europe. As an increase in consumers' satisfaction could lead to higher consumption rates and industry profitability, the introduction of an eating-quality guarantee system can contribute to market development and improved competitiveness of the European beef industry. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The ability to accurately predict the conception outcome for a future mating would be of considerable benefit for producers in deciding what mating plan (i.e., expensive semen or less expensive semen) to implement for a given cow. The objective of the present study was to use herd- and cow-level factors to predict the likelihood of conception success to a given insemination (i.e., conception outcome not including embryo loss); of particular interest in the present study was the usefulness of milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectral data in augmenting the accuracy of the prediction model. A total of 4,341 insemination records with conception outcome information from 2,874 lactations on 1,789 cows from 7 research herds for the years 2009 to 2014 were available. The data set was separated into a calibration data set and a validation data set using either of 2 approaches: (1) the calibration data set contained records from all 7 farms for the years 2009 to 2011, inclusive, and the validation data set included data from the 7 farms for the years 2012 to 2014, inclusive, or (2) the calibration data set contained records from 5 farms for all 6 yr and the validation data set contained information from the other 2 farms for all 6 yr. The prediction models were developed with 8 different machine learning algorithms in the calibration data set using standard 10-times 10-fold cross-validation and also by evaluating in the validation data set. The area under curve (AUC) for the receiver operating curve varied from 0.487 to 0.675 across the different algorithms and scenarios investigated. Logistic regression was generally the best-performing algorithm. The AUC was generally inferior for the external validation data sets compared with the calibration data sets. The inclusion of milk MIR in the prediction model generally did not improve the accuracy of prediction. Despite the fair AUC for predicting conception outcome under the different scenarios investigated, the model provided a reasonable prediction of the likelihood of conception success when the high predicted probability instances were considered; a conception rate of 85{\%} was evident in the top 10{\%} of inseminations ranked on predicted probability of conception success in the validation data set.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the application of BLUP and single step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) models in different scenarios of paternity uncertainty with different strategies of scaling the G matrix to match the A22 matrix, using simulated data for beef cattle. Genotypes, pedigree, and phenotypes for age at first calving (AFC) and weight at 550 days (W550) were simulated using heritabilities based on real data (0.12 for AFC and 0.34 for W550). Paternity uncertainty scenarios using 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100{\%} of multiple sires (MS) were studied. The simulated genome had a total length of 2,333 cM, containing 735,293 biallelic markers and 7,000 QTLs randomly distributed over the 29 BTA. It was assumed that QTLs explained 100{\%} of the genetic variance. For QTL, the amount of alleles per loci randomly ranged from two to four. The BLUP model that considers phenotypic and pedigree data, and the ssGBLUP model that combines phenotypic, pedigree and genomic information were used for genetic evaluations. Four ways of scaling the mean of the genomic matrix (G) to match to the mean of the pedigree relationship matrix among genotyped animals (A 22 ) were tested. Accuracy, bias, and inflation were investigated for five groups of animals: ALL = all animals; BULL = only bulls; GEN = genotyped animals; FEM = females; and YOUNG = young males. With the BLUP model, the accuracies of genetic evaluations decreased for both traits as the proportion of unknown sires in the population increased. The EBV accuracy reduction was higher for GEN and YOUNG groups. By analyzing the scenarios for YOUNG (from 0 to 100{\%} of MS), the decrease was 87.8 and 86{\%} for AFC and W550, respectively. When applying the ssGBLUP model, the accuracies of genetic evaluation also decreased as the MS in the pedigree for both traits increased. However, the accuracy reduction was less than those observed for BLUP model. Using the same comparison (scenario 0 to 100{\%} of MS), the accuracies reductions were 38 and 44.6{\%} for AFC and W550, respectively. There were no differences between the strategies for scaling the G matrix for ALL, BULL, and FEM groups under the different scenarios with missing pedigree. These results pointed out that the uninformative part of the A 22  matrix and genotyped animals with paternity uncertainty did not influence the scaling of G matrix. On the basis of the results, it is important to have a G matrix in the same scale of the A 22  matrix, especially for the evaluation of young animals in situations with missing pedigree information. In these situations, the ssGBLUP model is an appropriate alternative to obtain a more reliable and less biased estimate of breeding values, especially for young animals with few or no phenotypic records. For accurate and unbiased genomic predictions with ssGBLUP, it is necessary to assure that the G matrix is compatible with the A 22  matrix, even in situations with paternity uncertainty.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to standardize the infrared spectra obtained over time and across 2 milk laboratories of Canada to create a uniform historical database and allow (1) the retroactive application of calibration models for prediction of fine milk composition; and (2) the direct use of spectral information for the development of indicators of animal health and efficiency. Spectral variation across laboratories and over time was inspected by principal components analysis (PCA). Shifts in the PCA scores were detected over time, leading to the definition of different subsets of spectra having homogeneous infrared signal. To evaluate the possibility of using common equations on spectra collected by the 2 instruments and over time, we developed a standardization (STD) method. For each subset of data having homogeneous infrared signal, a total of 99 spectra corresponding to the percentiles of the distribution of the absorbance at each wavenumber were created and used to build the STD matrices. Equations predicting contents of saturated fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids, and C18:0 were created and applied on different subsets of spectra, before and after STD. After STD, bias and root mean squared error of prediction decreased by 66{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively. When calibration equations were applied to the historical nonstandardized database of spectra, shifts in the predictions could be observed over time for all investigated traits. Shifts in the distribution of the predictions over time corresponded to the shifts identified by the inspection of the PCA scores. After STD, shifts in the predicted fatty acid contents were greatly reduced. Standardization reduced spectral variability between instruments and over time, allowing the merging of milk spectra data from different instruments into a common database, the retroactive use of calibrations equations, or the direct use of the spectral data without restrictions.},

abstract = {Interest in methods that routinely and accurately measure and predict animal characteristics is growing in importance, both for quality characterization of live-stock products and for genetic purposes. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) is a rapid and cost-effective tool for recording phenotypes at the population level. Mid-infrared spectroscopy is based on crossing matter by electromagnetic radiation and on the subsequent mea-sure of energy absorption, and it is commonly used to determine traditional milk quality traits in official milk laboratories. The aim of this review was to focus on the use of MIRS to predict new milk phenotypes of eco-nomic relevance such as fatty acid and protein composi-tion, coagulation properties, acidity, mineral composi-tion, ketone bodies, body energy status, and methane emissions. Analysis of the literature demonstrated the feasibility of MIRS to predict these traits, with dif-ferent accuracies and with margins of improvement of prediction equations. In general, the reviewed papers underlined the influence of data variability, reference method, and unit of measurement on the development of robust models. A crucial point in favor of the ap-plication of MIRS is to stimulate the exchange of data among countries to develop equations that take into account the biological variability of the studied traits under different conditions. Due to the large variability of reference methods used for MIRS calibration, it is essential to standardize the methods used within and across countries.},

It can be used by stud and commercial beef producers, or potentially anyone in the production chain with an interest in selecting animals. Examples are given of uses by bull breeders, bull buyers, breed societies, semen companies and others. Opportunities for service providers are numerous, but payoffs depend on the capacity of users to capture sufficient of the benefits accruing from genetic improvement and the better identification of superior sires. INTRODUCTION Beef production is increasingly market driven. With this trend has come a greater need to balance different market traits and herd production traits when selecting seedstock. BREEDOBJECT (Barwick et al. 1992, 1994) is a selection tool for use with BREEDPLAN. It is a PC software package that helps with selection by drawing all the estimated breeding value (EBV) performance figures on a bull into a combined EBV for profit which describes how well the bull suits the user's purpose.},

abstract = {Breeding objectives for meat sheep in Ireland have been defined and used in the development of selection sub-indices to provide commercial producers with an economic comparison of animals for specific performance trait groups. Using trait-by-trait bio-economic models and a range of methodologies, economic weights (in € per lamb born per genetic standard deviation in the trait) have been calculated for maternal and terminal sire performance traits as follows: production traits; -€1.41 for days to slaughter, €0.35 for carcase conformation class, -€0.52 for carcase fat class, lambing traits; -€0.69 for lambing difficulty for single-bearing ewes, -€0.37 for lambing difficulty for multiple-bearing ewes, €1.15 for lamb survival, maternal traits; €0.83 for number of lambs born, -€1.49 for ewe mature weight, health traits; -€0.09 for lamb foot rot, and -€0.82 for ewe foot rot. Results indicate the significant value of improving the ability of lambs to survive to weaning, without increasing number of lambs born. The highly negative economic weight for both days to slaughter and mature size represents a powerful unfavourable relationship between the two traits. Economic values for lambing difficulty and foot rot represent the significant costs these traits have in the Irish sheep production system.In the early stages of the development of the genetic improvement program for sheep in Ireland the breeding objective defined in this paper provides directed emphasis for trait recording, selection strategies, and mating systems. In addition the economic weights provide indications as to how much genetic improvement in a specific trait would be worth paying for. The proposed formulation of the total economic index as sub-indices provides the ability for commercial farmers to adjust breeding emphasis towards specific market outcomes or address key production aspects in their particular farming system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Economic values for a range of different maternal and carcass sheep performance traits were derived for hill sheep in the United Kingdom. A bioeconomic model that includes estimates of available energy supply and herbage intake for sheep from hill and mountain pastures, together with that from improved grassland, has provided a base from which to define the economic limitations to genetic improvement in harsh environments. The degree to which different farm systems can accommodate changes in animal performance as a result of genetic improvement was explored. Results showed that genetic improvement in harsh environments is likely to be of greater benefit to farms with fewer constraints to improvements in production, such as better quality pasture or a higher ratio of improved grassland to hill pasture. For farm types in the harshest locations, the economic value of improving litter size was only positive within defined production limits. Increasing litter size beyond these limits resulted in diminishing marginal returns because the costs of additional inputs outweighed the benefits of extra returns. Results also showed that relative improvements in maternal characteristics are at least as economically important as improvements in lamb carcass quality. The effects of variation in market prices on economic values for the major costs and returns of the sheep enterprises showed that, in general, economic values are robust. The methodology described could be adapted and applied to other extensive sheep systems worldwide.},

abstract = {If a metric character is determined by an effectively infinite number of loci, selection cannot cause any permanent change in the genetic variance but will cause a temporary change which is rapidly reversed when selection ceases. This change is due entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases, the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its original value. An expression is derived for the predicted amount of change in the genetic variance due to disequilibrium in the absence of linkage. The change is likely to be small under selection intensities found under natural conditions, but it may be appreciable under intense artificial selection. This limiting result shows that the magnitude of any permanent change in the variance due to selection must decrease as the number of loci involved increases and that, when the number of loci is large, it is likely to be much less than the temporary change due to disequilibrium.

abstract = {The study investigates the genetic diversity present as well as its development in the Brown Cattle population of Switzerland from pedigree information. The population consisted of three subpopulations, the Braunvieh (BV), the original Braunvieh (OB) and the US-Brown Swiss (BS). The BV is a cross of OB with BS where crossing still continues. The OB is without any genetic influence of BS. The diversity measures effective population size, effective number of ancestors (explaining 99{\%} of reference genome) and founder genome equivalents were calculated for 11 reference populations of animals born in a single year from 1992 onwards. The BS-subpopulation consisted of animals and their known ancestors which were used in the crossing scheme and was, therefore, quite small. The youngest animals were born in 2002, the oldest ones in the 1920s. Average inbreeding was by far the highest in BS, in spite of the lowest quality of pedigrees, and lowest in OB. Effective population size obtained from the difference between average inbreeding of offspring and their parents was, mostly due to the heavy use of few highly inbred BS-sires, strongly overestimated in some BV-reference populations. If this parameter was calculated from the yearly rate of inbreeding and a generation interval of 5 years, no bias was observed and ranking of populations from high to low was OB-BV-BS, i.e. equal to the other diversity parameters. The high genetic diversity found in OB was a consequence of the use of many natural service sires. Rate of decrease of effective number of ancestors was steeper in BV than OB was, however, equal for founder genome equivalents. Founder genome equivalents were more stable than effective population sizes calculated from the difference between average inbreeding of offspring and parents. The five most important ancestors contributed one-third of the 2002-reference genomes of BV and OB, in BV all were BS-sires. The relative amount of BS-genes in the BV-genome increased from 59.2{\%} to 78.5{\%} during the 11 years considered.},

abstract = {Covariance components for final score and 13 linear type traits of dairy goats were estimated by multitrait REML using canonical transformation with an animal model. Data were 10,932 type appraisals from 1988 through 1994 from herds with {\textgreater} or = 40 appraisals. Heritabilities were estimated as 0.27 for final score, 0.52 for stature, 0.29 for strength, 0.24 for dairyness, 0.38 for teat diameter, 0.21 for rear legs, 0.32 for rump angle, 0.27 rump width, 0.25 for fore udder attachment, 0.25 for rear udder height, 0.19 for rear udder arch, 0.25 for udder depth, 0.33 for suspensory ligament, and 0.36 for teat placement. Genetic correlations of linear type traits and final score were positive except for dairyness (-0.15) and teat diameter (-0.10); the largest correlations with final score were 0.66 for fore udder attachment, 0.44 for rear udder arch, 0.36 for rump width, and 0.30 for strength. The largest positive correlation among linear traits was 0.63 for stature and rump width; the largest negative correlation was -0.51 for strength and dairyness. Multitrait evaluations were calculated with data from all herds. Correlations between PTA calculated with animal and sire models ranged from 0.44 to 0.70 for bucks that had a PTA with a reliability of {\textgreater} or = 30{\%}.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, American Marketing Association. Using the notion of customer concentration, the authors argue that firms should evenly spread their revenues across their customers, rather than focusing on a few major customer relationships. Prior literature suggests that major customers improve efficiency and provide access to resources, thereby producing positive performance outcomes. However, building on industrial organizational literature and modern portfolio theory, the authors argue that concentration of revenues reduces the supplier firm's bargaining power relative to its customers and hurts the ability of the supplier firm to appropriate value, which, in turn, hurts profits. Using a sample of 1,023 initial public offerings (IPOs) and robust econometricmethods, they find that customer concentration reduces investor uncertainty and positively impacts IPO outcomes, but significantly hurts balance sheet-based outcomes (e.g., profitability). The results suggest that a 10{\%} increase in customer concentration reduces profitability by 3.35{\%} (or about {\$}7 million) in the subsequent year, or 9.4{\%} cumulatively over the next four years (or about {\$}20.32 million). Further, the authors find that the negative effects of customer concentration decrease with increase in organizational (marketing, technological, and operational) capabilities and increase with low customer credit quality.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the prediction accuracy of 92 infrared prediction equations obtained by different statistical approaches. The predicted traits included fatty acid composition (n = 1,040); detailed protein composition (n = 1,137); lactoferrin (n = 558); pH and coagulation properties (n = 1,296); curd yield and composition obtained by a micro-cheese making procedure (n = 1,177); and Ca, P, Mg, and K contents (n = 689). The statistical methods used to develop the prediction equations were partial least squares regression (PLSR), Bayesian ridge regression, Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Model performances were assessed, for each trait and model, in training and validation sets over 10 replicates. In validation sets, Bayesian regression models performed significantly better than PLSR for the prediction of 33 out of 92 traits, especially fatty acids, whereas they yielded a significantly lower prediction accuracy than PLSR in the prediction of 8 traits: the percentage of C18:1n-7 trans-9 in fat; the content of unglycosylated $\kappa$-casein and its percentage in protein; the content of $\alpha$-lactalbumin; the percentage of $\alpha$S2-casein in protein; and the contents of Ca, P, and Mg. Even though Bayesian methods produced a significant enhancement of model accuracy in many traits compared with PLSR, most variations in the coefficient of determination in validation sets were smaller than 1 percentage point. Over traits, the highest predictive ability was obtained by Bayes C even though most of the significant differences in accuracy between Bayesian regression models were negligible.},

abstract = {To investigate the possibility of using carcass data from commercial slaughterhouses for the genetic evaluation of beef cattle, genetic parameters for carcass traits and their correlations with field-recorded growth traits were estimated. The data comprised information on carcass weight (CWT), carcass fleshiness (FLESH) and carcass fatness grade (FAT) according to the (S)EUROP scale for 5870, 1509 and 1119 young bulls of the Charolais, Hereford and Simmental breeds, respectively. In addition, information on field-recorded pre-weaning gain (WG) and post-weaning gain (PWG) was available for more than 23 200 and 15 700 bulls, respectively. The breeds were analysed separately using BLUP animal models. The results showed that it is feasible to include field-recorded carcass traits in the genetic evaluation. The estimated direct heritabilities of FLESH, FAT, CWT, WG and PWG were in the ranges 0.21-0.39, 0.23-0.45, 0.42-0.70, 0.31-0.41 and 0.29-0.42, respectively. The genetic correlations differed between breeds, though for all breeds studied the genetic correlations with pre-weaning gain were weaker for FAT and FLESH than for CWT. The effect of selection on pre-weaning gain appeared to be stronger for CWT than for the other traits. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Muscle fibre characteristics and biochemical properties of muscle recovered from young bulls of two genotypes (Aberdeen Angus Xand Charolais X), reared on two different diets (silage-based and barley-based) and slaughtered at varying ages between 10 and 19 months of age were established. These analyses were restricted to samples ofm. longissimus lumborum (LI) recovered at 48 h post mortem, vacuum packed and stored at 2°C for 14 days. Biochemical measurements included intramuscular fat content, intramuscular collagen content and its solubility, haem pigment concentration, sarcomere length and myofibril fragmentation. Muscle fibre type was classified according to the contractile nature of the fibres and their metabolic properties. Intramuscular fat content increased (P {\textless} 0-01) with age at slaughter and at a fixed age was greater for Angus X than Charolais X bulls (211-5 v. 295-8 mg/g dry matter, P {\textless} 0-01). Total intramuscular collagen and its solubility tended to decrease with age (P {\textless} 0-01). Differences in haem pigment concentration in samples of LI were detected between genotype (3-99 v. 3-59 mg/g for Angus X and Charolais X bulls; P {\textless} 0-01) and diet (3-97 v. 3-62 mg/g for bulls given barley and silage; P {\textless} 0-01), and increased with age at slaughter (P {\textless} 0-01). There was a significant increase in eye muscle cross-sectional area with increasing slaughter date (P {\textless} 0-01) and this was paralleled by an increase in cross-sectional area of individual muscle fibres (P {\textless} 0-001). Differences in cross-sectional area of individual muscle fibres between genotype and diet were small and inconsistent. Charolais X bulls had a greater percentage area of fast twitch glycolytic fibres than Angus X bulls (54-3 v. 49-3{\%}; P{\textless}0-01) and a smaller percentage area of slow twitch oxidative fibres (15-8 v. 18-9{\%}; P {\textless} 0-05). Beef tenderness was positively correlated (r = 0-48; P {\textless} 0-01) with the frequency of slow twitch oxidative fibres and negatively correlated (r = -0-38; P {\textless} 0-05) with the frequency of fast twitch glycolytic fibres.},

abstract = {Animal production is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. Depending on the accounting approaches and scope of emissions covered, estimates by various sources (IPCC, FAO, EPA or others) place livestock contribution to global anthropogenic GHG emissions at between 7 and 18 percent. The current analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential of nutritional, manure and animal husbandry practices for mitigating methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) – i.e. non-carbon dioxide (non-CO2) – GHG emissions from livestock production. These practices were categorized into enteric CH4, manure management and animal husbandry mitigation practices. Emphasis was placed on enteric CH4 mitigation practices for ruminant animals (only in vivo studies were considered) and manure mitigation practices for both ruminant and monogastric species. Over 900 references were reviewed; and simulation and life cycle assessment analyses were generally excluded. In evaluating mitigation practices, the use of proper units is critical. Expressing enteric CH4 energy production on gross energy intake basis, for example, does not accurately reflect the potential impact of diet quality and composition. Therefore, it is noted that GHG emissions should be expressed on a digestible energy intake basis or per unit of animal product (i.e. GHG emission intensity), because this reflects most accurately the effect of a given mitigation practice on feed intake and the efficiency of animal production.},

abstract = {Selection index methods can be used for deterministic assessment of the potential benefit of including marker information in genetic improvement programmes using marker-assisted selection (MAS). By specifying estimates of breeding values derived from marker information (M-EBV) as a correlated trait with heritability equal to 1, it was demonstrated that marker information can be incorporated in standard software for selection index predictions of response and rates of inbreeding, which requires specifying phenotypic traits and their genetic parameters. Path coefficient methods were used to derive genetic and phenotypic correlations between M-EBV and the phenotypic data. Methods were extended to multi-trait selection and to the case when M-EBV are based on high-density marker genotype data, as in genomic selection. Methods were applied to several example scenarios, which confirmed previous results that MAS substantially increases response to selection but also demonstrated that MAS can result in substantial reductions in the rates of inbreeding. Although further validation by stochastic simulation is required, the developed methodology provides an easy means of deterministically evaluating the potential benefits of MAS and to optimize selection strategies with availability of marker data.},

abstract = {Records from the milk recording scheme of Spanish Murciano-Granadina goats were studied to estimate genetic (co)variance components and breeding values throughout the first and second lactations. The data used consisted of 49,696 monthly test-day records of milk (MY), protein (PY), fat (FY), and dry matter (DMY) yields from 5,163 goats, distributed in 20 herds, offspring of 2,086 does and 206 bucks. These records were analyzed by 2-trait random regression models (RRM) and a repeatability test-day model (RTDM). At the middle of lactation, heritability estimates for MY, DMY, and FY obtained with RTDM were larger than those estimated with RRM, and the opposite was true for PY. The RRM estimates of heritability for MY, FY, and PY were very similar throughout the trajectories of both lactations. Heritability estimates for DMY decreased through the lactation period. The genetic correlations between the first and second lactation records estimated for all traits by RRM were positive and ranged from 0.43 to 0.80 throughout the lactation curves. The correlation between BV estimated with RTDM and RRM was 0.742 for MY and 0.664 for DMY. The RRM could be a useful alternative to RTDM for the prediction of BV in this breed.},

abstract = {Increasing consumer concern exists over the relationship between food composition and human health. Because of the known effects of fatty acids on human health, the development of a quick, inexpensive, and accurate method to directly quantify the fatty acid (FA) composition in milk would be valuable for milk processors to develop a payment system for milk pertinent to their customer requirements and for farmers to adapt their feeding systems and breeding strategies accordingly. The aim of this study was (1) to confirm the ability of mid-infrared spectrometry (MIR) to quantify individual FA content in milk by using an innovative procedure of sampling (i.e., samples were collected from cows belonging to different breeds, different countries, and in different production systems); (2) to compare 6 mathematical methods to develop robust calibration equations for predicting the contents of individual FA in milk; and (3) to test interest in using the FA equations developed in milk as basis to predict FA content in fat without corrections for the slope and the bias of the developed equations. In total, 517 samples selected based on their spectral variability in 3 countries (Belgium, Ireland, and United Kingdom) from various breeds, cows, and production systems were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The samples presenting the largest spectral variability were used to calibrate the prediction of FA by MIR. The remaining samples were used to externally validate the 28 FA equations developed. The 6 methods were (1) partial least squares regression (PLS); (2) PLS+repeatability file (REP); (3) first derivative of spectral data+PLS; (4) first derivative+REP+PLS; (5) second derivative of spectral data+PLS; and (6) second derivative+REP+PLS. Methods were compared on the basis of the cross-validation coefficient of determination (R2cv), the ratio of standard deviation of GC values to the standard error of cross-validation (RPD), and the validation coefficient of determination (R2v). The third and fourth methods had, on average, the highest R2cv, RPD, and R2v. The final equations were built using all GC and the best accuracy was observed for the infrared predictions of C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 trans, C18:1 cis-9, C18:1 cis, and for some groups of FA studied in milk (saturated, monounsaturated, unsaturated, short-chain, medium-chain, and long-chain FA). These equations showed R2cv greater than 0.95. With R2cv equal to 0.85, the MIR prediction of polyunsaturated FA could be used to screen the cow population. As previously published, infrared predictions of FA in fat are less accurate than those developed from FA content in milk (g/dL of milk) and no better results were obtained by using milk FA predictions if no corrections for bias and slope based on reference milk samples with known contents of FA were used. These results indicate the usefulness of equations with R2cv greater than 95{\%} in milk payment systems and the usefulness of equations with R2cv greater than 75{\%} for animal breeding purposes.},

In the cow–calf population (suckler cow population) of the same breed, the economic values of feed efficiency traits along with 15 further production and functional traits were calculated. The marginal economic values of clinical mastitis and claw disease incidence in the dairy system were −€70.65 and −€26.73 per case per cow and year, respectively. The marginal economic values for residual feed intake were −€55.15 and −€54.64/kg of dry matter per day for cows and breeding heifers in the dairy system and −€20.45, −€11.30, and −€6.04/kg of dry matter per day for cows, breeding heifers, and fattened animals in the cow–calf system, respectively, all expressed per cow and year. The sums of the relative economic values for the 2 new health traits in the dairy system and for residual feed intake across all cattle categories in both systems were 1.4 and 8{\%}, respectively. Within the dairy production system, the highest relative economic values were for milk yield (20{\%}), daily gain of calves (20{\%}), productive lifetime (10{\%}), and cow conception rate (8{\%}). In the cow–calf system, the most important traits were weight gain of calves from 120 to 210d and from birth to 120d (19 and 14{\%}, respectively), productive lifetime (17{\%}), and cow conception rate (13{\%}). Based on the calculation of economic values for traits in the dual-purpose Pinzgau breed, milk production and growth traits remain highly important in the breeding goal, but their relative importance should be adapted to new production and economic conditions. The economic importance of functional traits (especially of cow productive lifetime and fertility) was sufficiently high to make the inclusion of these traits into the breeding goal necessary. An increased interest of consumers in animal welfare and quality of dairy farm products should probably lead to the incorporation of health traits (clinical mastitis incidence and somatic cells score) into the breeding goal. However, keeping carcass traits in the breeding goal of the Slovak Pinzgau breed does not seem to be relevant to the long-term market situation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In den letzten Jahren hat die durchschnittliche Fettgewebeklasse von Tieren der Markenprogramme Natura-Veal, Natura-Beef und SwissPrimBeef abgenommen. Natura- Veal sind Bankk{\"{a}}lber, die mit einem Alter von ungef{\"{a}}hr sechs Monaten direkt von der Mutter abgesetzt geschlachtet werden. Natura-Beef bezeichnet Fleisch von Jungtieren aus Mutterkuhhaltung, die als schlachtreife Absetzer mit ungef{\"{a}}hr zehn Monaten geschlachtet werden. SwissPrimBeef bezeichnet ebenfalls Fleisch aus Mutterkuhhaltung. Bis zum Absetzen wachsen die K{\"{a}}lber im Herdenverband bei der Mutter auf. Danach werden die Tiere bis zu einem Alter von ungef{\"{a}}hr 20 Monaten ausgem{\"{a}}stet. Die Entwicklung der abnehmenden Fettgewebeklasse ist nicht erwünscht. Zurzeit existiert in der Schweiz keine Zuchtwertsch{\"{a}}tzung für Fettgewebeklassen. Aus diesem Grund wurden in dieser Masterarbeit die Schlachtdaten der drei Markenprogramme von 2005 bis Mitte 2015 analysiert. In einem Modell A wurden die Fettgewebeklassen über alle Markenprogramme ausgewertet. Als fixe Effekte modelliert wurden Nettozunahme, Rasse, Geschlecht, Fleischigkeitsklasse, Markenprogramm, Markenprogramm*Alter und Markenprogramm*Alter2. Betrieb*Jahr wurde als zuf{\"{a}}lliger Effekt modelliert. In Modell B wurde jedes Markenprogramm separat ausgewertet. Modelliert wurden Nettozunahme, Rasse, Geschlecht, Fleischigkeitsklasse, Alter und Alter2 als fixe und Betrieb*Jahr als zuf{\"{a}}lliger Effekt. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich der Effekt der Rasse auf die Fettgewebeklasse je nach Modell {\"{a}}ndert. Das heisst, es besteht eine Interaktion zwischen Markenprogramm und Rasse. W{\"{a}}hrend Angus in allen Markenprogrammen eine hohe Fettabdeckung erzielt, weisen Tiere der Rasse Grauvieh besonders im Natura-Veal eine gute Fettabdeckung auf. Als Natura-Beef weisen neben Hereford und Angus auch die Rassen Original Braunvieh, Limousin, Simmental und Aubrac gute Fettabdeckungen aus. Bei SwissPrimBeef sind es neben Hereford und Angus auch Tiere der Rasse Simmental und Salers, die eine gute Fettabdeckung aufweisen. In allen Modellen hatten weibliche Tiere eine h{\"{o}}here Fettabdeckung als m{\"{a}}nnliche kastrierte Tiere und diese hatten wiederum eine h{\"{o}}here Fettabdeckung als m{\"{a}}nnliche Tiere. Auch das Alter, das Alter2, die Nettozunahme und die Fleischigkeit haben einen signifikanten Effekt auf die Fettgewebeklasse. Die Auswertungen haben gezeigt, dass sowohl Modell A als auch Modell B akzeptable Resultate liefern. In Modell A sollte jedoch die Interaktion zwischen Markenprogramm und Rasse berücksichtigt werden. In einem n{\"{a}}chsten Schritt müssten die Modelle mit dem Tiereffekt erg{\"{a}}nzt werden, um die Verwandtschaft der Tiere zu berücksichtigen. Zus{\"{a}}tzlich sollte man genetische Gruppen für Rassen sch{\"{a}}tzen und nicht mit der Rasse mit dem h{\"{o}}chsten Blutanteil arbeiten. Eine Zuchtwertsch{\"{a}}tzung für die Fettgewebeklasse ist wichtig, um die Fleischqualit{\"{a}}t in Zukunft zu verbessern. Dabei sollte die Fettgewebeklasse und die Fleischigkeitsklasse in einem für den Landwirt anwendbarem Index vereint werden.},

abstract = {Abstract Prior to genomic selection on a trait, a reference population needs to be established to link marker genotypes with phenotypes. For costly and difficult-to-measure traits, international collaboration and sharing of data between disciplines may be necessary. Our aim was to characterize the combining of data from nutrition studies carried out under similar climate and management conditions to estimate genetic parameters for feed efficiency. Furthermore, we postulated that data from the experimental cohorts within these studies can be used to estimate the net energy of lactation (NEL) densities of diets, which can provide estimates of energy intakes for use in the calculation of the feed efficiency metric, residual feed intake (RFI), and potentially reduce the effect of variation in energy density of diets. Individual feed intakes and corresponding production and body measurements were obtained from 13 Midwestern nutrition experiments. Two measures of RFI were considered, RFIMcal and RFIkg, which involved the regression of NEL intake (Mcal/d) or dry matter intake (DMI; kg/d) on 3 expenditures: milk energy, energy gained or lost in body weight change, and energy for maintenance. In total, 677 records from 600 lactating cows between 50 and 275 d in milk were used. Cows were divided into 46 cohorts based on dietary or nondietary treatments as dictated by the nutrition experiments. The realized NEL densities of the diets (Mcal/kg of DMI) were estimated for each cohort by totaling the average daily energy used in the 3 expenditures for cohort members and dividing by the cohort's total average daily DMI. The NEL intake for each cow was then calculated by multiplying her DMI by her cohort's realized energy density. Mean energy density was 1.58 Mcal/kg. Heritability estimates for RFIkg, and RFIMcal in a single-trait animal model did not differ at 0.04 for both measures. Information about realized energy density could be useful in standardizing intake data from different climate conditions or management systems, as well as investigating potential genotype by diet interactions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Profitability of beef production can be increased by genetically improving carcass traits. To construct breeding value evaluations for carcass traits, breed-specific genetic parameters were estimated for carcass weight, carcass conformation and carcass fat in five beef cattle breeds in Finland (Hereford, Aberdeen Angus, Simmental, Charolais and Limousin). Conformation and fat were visually scored using the EUROP carcass classification. Each breed was separately analyzed using a multitrait animal model. A total of 6879–19 539 animals per breed had phenotypes. For the five breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.39 to 0.48, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04) and slightly lower for conformation ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.30 to 0.44, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04) and carcass fat ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}h{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} =0.29 to 0.44, s.e.=0.02 to 0.04). The genetic correlation between carcass weight and conformation was favorable in all breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.37 to 0.53, s.e.=0.04 to 0.05), heavy carcasses being genetically more conformed. The phenotypic correlation between carcass weight and carcass fat was moderately positive in all breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.21 to 0.32), implying that increasing carcass weight was related to increasing fat levels. The respective genetic correlation was the strongest in Hereford ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.28, s.e.=0.05) and Angus ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.15, s.e.=0.05), the two small body-sized British breeds with the lowest conformation and the highest fat level. The correlation was weaker in the other breeds ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.08 to 0.14). For Hereford, Angus and Simmental, more conformed carcasses were phenotypically fatter ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.11 to 0.15), but the respective genetic correlations were close to zero ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.05 to 0.04). In contrast, in the two large body-sized and muscular French breeds, the genetic correlation between conformation and fat was negative and the phenotypic correlation was close to zero or negative (Charolais: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.18, s.e.=0.06, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} =0.02; Limousin: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.56, s.e.=0.04, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}P{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}bold{\textgreater}−{\textless}/bold{\textgreater} 0.13). The results indicate genetic variation for the genetic improvement of the carcass traits, favorable correlations for the simultaneous improvement of carcass weight and conformation in all breeds, and breed differences in the correlations of carcass fat. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to estimate, for the Italian Simmental cattle population, genetic parameters for 92 traits and their infrared predictions (IP) and to investigate the genetic relationship between measured traits (MT) and IP. Data for milk fat fatty acid composition (n = 1,040), detailed protein composition (n = 3,337), lactoferrin (n = 558), pH (n = 3,438), coagulation properties (n = 3,266), curd yield and composition obtained by a micro-cheese making procedure (n = 1,177), and content of Ca, P, Mg, and K (n = 689) were obtained using reference laboratory analysis. Infrared prediction for all the investigated traits was performed using 143,198 spectra records belonging to 17,619 Italian Simmental cows. (Co)variance components for MT and their IP were estimated in a set of bivariate animal model REML analyses and genetic correlations between MT and IP were estimated using all IP obtained at the population level. A significant positive relationship was observed between the coefficient of determination of the infrared prediction models and the phenotypic and genetic variation of the IP. The decrease in the estimated genetic variance of IP compared with MT was on average 64{\%}. For traits exhibiting calibration models with coefficients of determination in cross-validation (R2CV) greater than 0.9, the decrease in the genetic variance ranged from approximately 20 to 50{\%}. Most traits (88 out of 92) exhibited lower heritability estimates for IP than for the corresponding MT. The estimated genetic correlations between IP and MT (ra) were in general very high. A positive relationship (r = 0.57) between R2CV of calibration models and the estimated ra has been detected. For calibration models exhibiting R2CV higher than 0.75, ra were greater than 0.9. The variability in the estimated correlations increased when R2CV decreased, and for calibration models of moderate predictive ability, estimates of ra ranged from 0.2 to 1. Genetic parameter estimates suggested that IP can be used as indicator traits in breeding programs for the enhancement of fine composition and technological properties of milk. The genetic gain achievable selecting for IP is expected to be high for fatty acid composition, minerals, and for technological properties of milk, whereas it will be low for casein and whey protein composition and for the content of lactoferrin.},

abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (N e 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilib-rium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

@article{Berry2017,
abstract = {Apprehension among consumers is mounting on the efficiency by which
cattle convert feedstuffs into human edible protein and energy as well
as the consequential effects on the environment. Most (genetic) studies
that attempt to address these issues have generally focused on
efficiency metrics defined over a certain time period of an animal's
life cycle, predominantly the period representing the linear phase of
growth. The age at which an animal reaches the carcass specifications
for slaughter, however, is also known to vary between breeds; less is
known on the extent of the within-breed variability in age at slaughter.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify the
phenotypic and genetic variability in the age at which cattle reach a
predefined carcass weight and subcutaneous fat cover. A novel trait,
labeled here as the deviation in age at slaughter (DAGE), was
represented by the unexplained variability from a statistical model,
with age at slaughter as the dependent variable and with the fixed
effects, among others, of carcass weight and fat score (scale 1 to 15
scored by video image analysis of the carcass at slaughter). Variance
components for DAGE were estimated using either a 2-step approach (i.e.,
the DAGE phenotype derived first and then variance components estimated)
or a 1-step approach (i.e., variance components for age at slaughter
estimated directly in a mixed model that included the fixed effects of,
among others, carcass weight and carcass fat score as well as a random
direct additive genetic effect). The raw phenotypic SD in DAGE was 44.2
d. The genetic SD and heritability for DAGE estimated using the 1-step
or 2-step models varied from 14.2 to 15.1 d and from 0.23 to 0.26 (SE
0.02), respectively. Assuming the (genetic) variability in the number of
days from birth to reaching a desired carcass specifications can be
exploited without any associated unfavorable repercussions, considerable
potential exists to improve not only the (feed) efficiency of the animal
and farm system but also the environmental footprint of the system. The
beauty of the approach proposed, relative to strategies that select
directly for the feed intake complex and enteric methane emissions, is
that data on age at slaughter are generally readily available. Of
course, faster gains may potentially be achieved if a dual objective of
improving animal efficiency per day coupled with reduced days to
slaughter was embarked on.},

Since the method was first published by Henderson (1949), it has evolved in terms of its application in models for genetic evaluation, from sire, sire and maternal grandsires models in the early years, followed by univariate and multivariate animal models, and more recently to random regression models for the analysis of longitudinal data.

abstract = {Test-day data for daily milk yield and fat, protein, and lactose content were sampled from the years 1988 to 2003 in 17 flocks belonging to 2 genetically well-tied buck circles. In total, records from 2,111 to 2,215 goats for content traits and 2,371 goats for daily milk yield were included in the analysis, averaging 2.6 and 4.8 observations per goat for the 2 groups of traits, respectively. The data were analyzed by using 4 test-day models with different modeling of fixed effects. Model [0] (the reference model) contained a fixed effect of year-season of kidding with regression on Ali-Schaeffer polynomials nested within the year-season classes, and a random effect of flock test-day. In model [1], the lactation curve effect from model [0] was replaced by a fixed effect of days in milk (in 3-d periods), the same for all year-seasons of kidding. Models [2] and [3] were obtained from model [1] by removing the fixed year-season of kidding effect and considering the flock test-day effect as either fixed or random, respectively. The models were compared by using 2 criteria: mean-squared error of prediction and a test of bias affecting the genetic trend. The first criterion indicated a preference for model [3], whereas the second criterion preferred model [1]. Mean-squared error of prediction is based on model fit, whereas the second criterion tests the ability of the model to produce unbiased genetic evaluation (i.e., its capability of separating environmental and genetic time trends). Thus, a fixed structure with year (year, year-season, or possibly flock-year) was indicated to appropriately separate time trends. Heritability estimates for daily milk yield and milk content were 0.26 and 0.24 to 0.27, respectively.},

abstract = {In rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, females typically mature at a later age than males, and males mature either early or late. When farmed rainbow trout is produced to obtain large fillets of high quality, especially early maturation of males reduces economical benefits. To examine whether it is possible to change the degree of this sexual dimorphism using selective breeding, we estimated sex-specific heritabilities, genetic correlations between sexes, and cross-environment correlations between two production environments for age at maturity and body weight. Extensive data set including individuals in five generations measured in brackish and fresh water in a split-family design was utilised to estimate the genetic parameters. The timing of maturity (h2= 0.12-0.56) and body weight (h2= 0.20-0.27) exhibited significant heritabilities, allowing genetic changes in trait means in response to selection. Genetic change in sexual dimorphism of body weight is, however, strongly constrained, as shown by the high genetic correlations between sexes (rA≥ 0.95). For timing of maturity, the heritabilities of males and females differed, but the genetic correlation between sexes was high and positive (rA= 0.70). Although sexual dimorphism of age at maturity is less strongly contained than that of body weights, we conclude that no rapid genetic changes can be achieved in the sexual dimoiphism of age at maturity through selective breeding. However, breeders may delay the timing of maturity in both sexes to avoid the drawbacks associated with the early maturation. Cross-environment correlations for the timing of maturity and body weight were highly positive (rA≥ 0.61), indicating weak genotype-by-environment interactions and allowing parallel genetic changes in two environments where rainbow trout is farmed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to identify if genomic variations associated with fatty acid (FA) composition are similar between the Holstein-Friesian (HF) and native dual-purpose breeds used in the Dutch dairy industry. Phenotypic and genotypic information were available for the breeds Meuse-Rhine-Yssel (MRY), Dutch Friesian (DF), Groningen White Headed (GWH), and HF. First, the reliability of genomic breeding values of the native Dutch dual-purpose cattle breeds MRY, DF, and GWH was evaluated using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects estimated in HF, including all SNP or subsets with stronger associations in HF. Second, the genomic variation of the regions associated with FA composition in HF (regions on Bos taurus autosome 5, 14, and 26), were studied in the different breeds. Finally, similarities in genotype and allele frequencies between MRY, DF, GWH, and HF breeds were assessed for specific regions associated with FA composition. On average across the traits, the highest reliabilities of genomic prediction were estimated for GWH (0.158) and DF (0.116) when the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were included. With the same set of SNP, GEBV for MRY were the least reliable (0.022). This indicates that on average only 2 (MRY) to 16{\%} (GWH) of the genomic variation in HF is shared with the native Dutch dual-purpose breeds. The comparison of predicted variances of different regions associated with milk and milk fat composition showed that breeds clearly differed in genomic variation within these regions. Finally, the correlations of allele frequencies between breeds across the 8 to 22 SNP with the strongest association in HF were around 0.8 between the Dutch native dual-purpose breeds, whereas the correlations between the native breeds and HF were clearly lower and around 0.5. There was no consistent relationship between the reliabilities of genomic prediction for a specific breed and the correlation between the allele frequencies of this breed and HF. In conclusion, most of the genomic variation associated with FA composition in the Dutch dual-purpose breeds appears to be breed-specific. Furthermore, the minor allele frequencies of genes having an effect on the milk FA composition in HF were shown to be much smaller in the breeds MRY, DF, and GWH, especially for the MRY breed.},

abstract = {A maternal breeding goal for the UK beef industry is described and economic selection indexes are developed to assist in the selection of animals for the goal. The breeding objective is made up of general maternal ability traits, cow size, calving and carcass traits. The general maternal ability traits include calving interval, age at. first calving, lifespan, maternal weaning weight and maternal calving difficulty. The calculations of economic values for the traits are outlined and discounted genetic expression coefficients are presented. Three selection indexes are illustrated. The. first provides a general dual-purpose index for the selection of bulls to produce replacement heifers in most situations. The second, the hardy breed index, is designed to allow selection for improved maternal performance in extensive and hardy environments. The third, the fertile herd index, allows producers who do not have herd fertility problems to place more selection emphasis on objectives other than fertility. A sample of data from the Limousin breed was used to calculate estimated breeding values (EBVs) which were used to investigate response to the three indexes when the top 20{\%} of sires were selected from either sires with 50 or more grand-maternal progeny or bulls with no recorded progeny. Approximately two thirds of the economic response seen in the selection of heavily used bulls was observed in bulls with no progeny for the hardy and dual-purpose indexes. Bulls were also selected using the existing UK terminal sire index and the resulting bulls assessed in the dual-purpose maternal index. There was found to be a negative economic response to the maternal aspect of the index, though a positive response was seen in the carcass objective. The indexes are presented as the sum of four subindexes emphasizing the contribution of maternal ability, cow size, calving and carcass, respectively to the total index. This further assists commercial producers in selection decisions.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the common method of exploiting infrared spectral data in animal breeding; that is, estimating the breeding values for the traits predicted by infrared spectroscopy, and an alternative approach based on the direct use of spectral information (direct prediction, DP) to predict the estimated breeding values (EBV). Traits were pH, milk coagulation properties, contents of the main casein and whey protein fractions, cheese yield measured by micro-cheese making, lactoferrin, Ca, and fat composition. For the DP method, the number of spectral variables was reduced by principal components analysis to 8 latent traits that explained 99{\%} of the original spectral variation. Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate variance components of the latent traits. (Co)variance components of the original spectral traits were obtained by back-transformation and EBV of all derived milk traits were then predicted as traits correlated with the genetic information of the spectra. The rank correlation between the EBV obtained for the infrared-predicted traits and those obtained from the DP method was variable across traits. Rank correlations ranged from 0.07 (for the content of saturated fatty acids expressed as g/100 g of fat) to 0.96 (for dry matter cheese yield, {\%}) and, for most traits, was {\textless}0.5. This result can be explained by the nature of the principal components analysis: it does not take into account the covariance between the spectral variables and the reference traits but produces latent traits that maximize the spectral variance explained. Thus, the direct approach is more likely to be effective for traits more related to the main sources of spectral variation (i.e., protein and fat). More research is required to study spectral genetic variation and to determine the best way to choose spectral regions and the type and number of considered latent traits for potential applications.},

The objective of the present study was to examine sire-level genetic profiles for car- cass weight, carcass conformation, and carcass fat in cattle of multiple beef and dairy breeds, including crossbreeds. Slaughter records from 126,214 heifers and 124,641 steers aged between 360 and 1,200 d and from 86,089 young bulls aged between 360 and 720 d were used in the analysis; animals were from 15,127 sires. Variance components for each trait across age at slaughter were generated using sire random regression models that included quadratic polynomials for fixed and random effects; hetero- geneous residual variances were assumed across ages. Heritability estimates across genders ranged from 0.08 (±0.02) to 0.34 (±0.02) for carcass weight, from 0.24 (±0.02) to 0.42 (±0.01) for conformation, and from 0.16 (±0.03) to 0.40 (±0.02) for fat score. Genetic correlations within each trait across ages weakened as the interval between ages compared lengthened but were all {\textgreater}0.64, suggesting a similar genetic background for each trait across different ages. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the additive genetic covariance matrix revealed genetic variabil- ity among animals in their growth profiles for carcass traits, although most of the genetic variability was associated with the height of the growth profile. At the same age, a positive genetic correlation (0.60 to 0.78; SE ranged from 0.01 to 0.04) existed between carcass weight and conformation, whereas negative genetic correlations existed between fatness and both conformation (–0.46 to 0.08; SE ranged from 0.02 to 0.09) and carcass weight (–0.48 to –0.16; SE ranged from 0.02 to 0.14) at the same age. The estimated genetic parameters in the present study indicate genetic variability in the growth trajectory in cattle, which can be exploited through breeding programs and used in decision support tools.},

abstract = {Carcass quality of 72 steers, 48 heifers and 21 bulls from continental and dairy genotypes were compared on the basis of conformation, fatness and saleable meat yield (SMY{\%}) of the fillet and trimmed boneless sirloin cuts. Comparisons between genotype and gender groups showed that steers from beef breeds had higher EUROP conformation scores than those from dairy breeds which corresponded to a higher SMY{\%} of sirloin and fillet. Results suggested that the EUROP grid may underestimate the sirloin SMY{\%} of Charolais heifers due to their higher muscle-to-bone ratio. Furthermore, the 141 carcasses were used to assess the accuracy with which video image analysis (VIA) and visual classification in a commercial abattoir predicted the weight and SMY{\%} of the sirloin and fillet. Both VIA and the visual carcass classification systems resulted in similar accuracies for prediction of sirloin SMY{\%} (R2=58{\%}, RSD=0.35{\%} for VIA and R2=57{\%}, RSD=0.35{\%} for visual classification) but fillet yield was poorly predicted by both VIA and visual classification systems. Including the weight of excess fat removed during sirloin fabrication as an additional covariate for sirloin SMY{\%} prediction did not offer any substantial improvement in predictive ability. Inclusion of bone weight as an additional covariate did show some promise for improving the prediction accuracy of fillet SMY{\%}. The fact that no statistically significant correlations between fillet yield and EUROP carcass classification categories (assigned visually or by the VIA) could be identified after adjustment for genotype further justifies the need to consider alternative modes of carcass evaluation to better reflect the distribution of meat throughout the carcass. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

Beef performance evaluations in the Republic of Ireland have focused on improvement in carcass traits as the breeding goal due to the volumes of data available for this trait from the commercial beef and dairy herds.

abstract = {Semen volume (SV), semen output (SO), semen motility (SM), number of semen doses per ejaculate (NSD) and semen concentration (SC) were analyzed on a phenotypic and quantitative genetic scale in dependency of the continuous environmental descriptor THI (=an index describing combinations of temperature with humidity). Longitudinal semen data included 10,341 observations from 562 Holstein sires kept on an AI station in the northwestern part of Germany. Statistical modeling was based on fixed and random regression methodology (RRM). In this context, the phenotypic and genetic trajectory of traits in dependency of THI was modeled by orthogonal polynomials, i.e. Legendre polynomials of order 3. A general heat stress threshold of THI=60 was identified, and indicating detrimental effects of heat stress beyond this threshold, especially on SV, SO, NSD, and SC. Least square means for semen productivity were generally higher for adult bulls, but compared to young bulls, adult bulls responded with stronger semen production losses for extremely high THI. The optimal environment for semen production was a THI in the range from 50 to 60. Detrimental impact of heat stress was reduced for bulls with longer intervals between consecutive semen collection dates. Heritabilities for semen traits were in a low to moderate range with the following maximal values: 0.18 for SV at THI 30, 0.29 for SM at THI 70, 0.26 for SO at THI 30, 0.26 for NSD at THI 58, and 0.27 for SC at THI 53. Genetic values of sires and additive genetic variances changed with alterations of THI, with highest genetic variances at the extreme ends of the continuous environmental descriptor. Genetic correlations in same traits from THI levels in great distance were lower than 0.80, and indicated genotype by environment interactions. Application of RRM allow to select sires according to THI specific breeding values, which implies an optimization of cow sire and bull sire selection for harsh environments.},

Considerable progress has been made in the use of tools to routinely monitor and collect information from animals and farms in a less laborious manner than before. These efforts have enabled the animal sciences to embark on information technology-driven discoveries to improve animal agriculture. However, the growing amount and complexity of data generated by fully automated, high-throughput data recording or phenotyping platforms, including digital images, sensor and sound data, unmanned systems, and information obtained from real-time noninvasive computer vision, pose challenges to the successful implementation of precision animal agriculture. The emerging fields of machine learning and data mining are expected to be instrumental in helping meet the daunting challenges facing global agriculture. Yet, their impact and potential in “big data” analysis have not been adequately appreciated in the animal science community, where this recognition has remained only fragmentary. To address such knowledge gaps, this article outlines a framework for machine learning and data mining and offers a glimpse into how they can be applied to solve pressing problems in animal sciences.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) emission is an important environmental trait in dairy cows. Breeding aiming to mitigate CH4 emissions require the estimation of genetic correlations with other economically important traits and the prediction of their selection response. In this study, test-day CH4 emissions were predicted from milk mid-infrared spectra of Holstein cows. Predicted CH4 emissions (PME) and log-transformed CH4 intensity (LMI) computed as the natural logarithm of PME divided by milk yield (MY). Genetic correlations of PME and LMI with traits used currently were approximated from correlations between estimated breeding values of sires. Values were for PME with MY 0.06, fat yield (FY) 0.09, protein yield (PY) 0.13, fertility 0.17; body condition score (BCS) –0.02; udder health (UDH) 0.22; and longevity 0.22. As expected by its definition, values were negative for LMI with production traits (MY –0.61; FY –0.15 and PY –0.40) and positive with fertility (0.36); BCS (0.20); UDH (0.08) and longevity (0.06). The genetic correlations of 33 type traits with PME ranged from –0.12 to 0.25 and for LMI ranged from –0.22 to 0.18. Without selecting PME and LMI (status quo) the relative genetic change through correlated responses of other traits were in PME by 2{\%} and in LMI by –15{\%}, but only due to the correlated response to MY. Results showed for PME that direct selection of this environmental trait would reduce milk carbon foot print but would also affect negatively fertility. Therefore, more profound changes in current indexes will be required than simply adding environmental traits as these traits also affect the expected progress of other traits.},

abstract = {Genetic evaluations of US dairy goats are calculated an-nually by USDA from records that are available through Dairy Herd Improvement programs and the American Dairy Goat Association (ADGA). The number of does in test plans used in genetic evaluations was 11,273 during 1999; participation in linear appraisal programs during 1999 was 3784 does, a decrease from the mean of 4285 does over the last 5 yr. For evaluation of yield traits, an animal model similar to that used for dairy cattle is used, but analysis is across breeds. Lactation records for the first six parities of does that were born since July 1973 and kidded since January 1976 are edited within limits appropriate for goats, projected to 305 d, and adjusted for kidding age and month. Evaluations are computed for milk, fat, and protein yields and component percentages; an economic index based on genetic merit for milk, fat, and pro-tein yields (MFP{\$}) is calculated, based on economic values for dairy cattle. A multitrait animal model is applied to 13 linear type traits and final score. A single-trait calculation method is accomplished by applying a canonical transforma-tion. Annual genetic progress for does born during 1996 as a percentage of mean breed yield was lowest for Toggenburgs (–0.1{\%}/yr, milk; 0.0{\%}/yr, fat and protein) and highest for Saanens (0.9{\%}/yr, milk and protein; 1.0{\%}/yr, fat). Annual genetic trend for type traits across breeds for does born during 1996 was 0.67 for stature; 0.37 for rump angle; 0.34 for teat placement; 0.22 for suspensory ligament; 0.20 for strength; 0.16 for teat diameter; 0.12 for rump width; 0.09 for rear legs; 0.06 for dairyness; 0.05 for final score; 0.01 for fore udder attachment and udder depth; –0.1 for udder depth; and –0.12 for rear udder height. Two production-type indexes are com-puted by ADGA with 2:1 and 1:2 weightings for yield (repre-sented by genetic merit for fat-corrected milk) and type (repre-sented by genetic merit for final score).},

abstract = {Background: A condition to predict unbiased estimated breeding values by best linear unbiased prediction is to use simultaneously all available data. However, this condition is not often fully met. For example, in dairy cattle, internal (i.e. local) populations lead to evaluations based only on internal records while widely used foreign sires have been selected using internally unavailable external records. In such cases, internal genetic evaluations may be less accurate and biased. Because external records are unavailable, methods were developed to combine external information that summarizes these records, i.e. external estimated breeding values and associated reliabilities, with internal records to improve accuracy of internal genetic evaluations. Two issues of these methods concern double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. These issues could be worse if external information came from several evaluations, at least partially based on the same records, and combined into a single internal evaluation. Based on a Bayesian approach, the aim of this research was to develop a unified method to integrate and blend simultaneously several sources of information into an internal genetic evaluation by avoiding double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. Results: This research resulted in equations that integrate and blend simultaneously several sources of information and avoid double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. The performance of the developed equations was evaluated using simulated and real datasets. The results showed that the developed equations integrated and blended several sources of information well into a genetic evaluation. The developed equations also avoided double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. Furthermore, because all available external sources of information were correctly propagated, relatives of external animals benefited from the integrated information and, therefore, more reliable estimated breeding values were obtained. Conclusions: The proposed unified method integrated and blended several sources of information well into a genetic evaluation by avoiding double-counting of contributions due to relationships and due to records. The unified method can also be extended to other types of situations such as single-step genomic or multi-trait evaluations, combining information across different traits.

The intention of the sub-indexes was to simplify selection decisions by commercial bull and semen buyers for situations where all of the resulting progeny are slaughtered, or when some female progeny are kept as replacement breeding cows. Separate sets of economic values for calving ease and gestation length are proposed for use in separate calving sub-indexes depending on whether dairy cows or beef cows are to be mated. Proposed economic values for calf quality, growth, calving and reproduction sub-indexes were assumed to be independent of the breed of cow to be mated. It was also recommended that separate total indexes for dairy cow and beef cow matings be constructed as simple linear functions of the sub-indexes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We use a linear mixed model for analysis of binary traits and transform the estimates to a liability scale by adjusting both for scale and for ascertainment of the case samples. We show by theory and simulation that the method is unbiased.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Alpine transhumance or droving livestock to mountainous areas during summer months is highly relevant for Austrian agriculture but also for other countries in Alpine regions. Access of rearing stock to mountain pastures is often claimed to be beneficial with respect to health and longevity, but the robust evidence is scarce. Therefore, its effect was tested by including it in the routine genetic evaluation data set for longevity. Alpine transhumance records from 2004 to 2013 were used. After several plausibility checks and restriction to animals with sire and dam known, records of 871 287 dual-purpose Fleckvieh cows sired by 9953 bulls were available. Data were analysed by means of survival analysis accounting for the time-dependent fixed effects of region-year-season, relative performance within herd, change of herd size, and Alpine pasturing of cows, the fixed effects age at first calving and Alpine pasturing of rearing stock, the random time-dependent effect of herd-year and the random genetic effects of sire and maternal grandsire. Fleckvieh cows that had access to Alpine pasture during their rearing period at least once for a minimum of 60 days had functional longevity that was nearly 2 months prolonged compared with cows that had always stayed on the farms as calves or heifers. In a more detailed analysis, the lowest relative culling risk among the significant estimates was observed for cows that had been Alpine pastured in years 1 and 3; it was about 15{\%} below that of cows that never had access to mountain grazing. Evidence for the beneficial effect of Alpine pasturing of rearing stock on the animals' later fitness, indicated by longevity, could thus be provided.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Fitted values for DMP were calculated from the area under the curves. Two methods of relating methane and feed intakes were then studied: the classical calculation of MY as DMP/DMI (kg/day); and a novel method of estimating DMP from time and size of preceding meals using either the data for only the two meals preceding a spot measurement, or all meals for 3 days prior. Two approaches were also used to estimate DMP from spot measurements: fitting of splines on a ‘per-animal per-day' basis and an alternate approach of modelling DMP after each feed event by least squares (using Solver), summing (for each animal) the contributions from each feed event by best-fitting a one-compartment model. Time since the preceding meal was of limited value in estimating DMP. Even when the meal sizes and time intervals between a spot measurement and all feeding events in the previous 72 h were assessed, only 16.9{\%} of the variance in spot emission rate measured by GEM was explained by this feeding information. While using the preceding meal alone gave a biased (underestimate) of DMP, allowing for a longer feed history removed this bias. A power analysis taking into account the sources of variation in DMP indicated that to obtain an estimate of DMP with a 95{\%} confidence interval within 5{\%} of the observed 64 days mean of spot measures would require 40 animals measured over 45 days (two spot measurements per day) or 30 animals measured over 55 days. These numbers suggest that spot measurements could be made in association with feed efficiency tests made over 70 days. Spot measurements of enteric emissions can be used to define DMP but the number of animals and samples are larger than are needed when day-long measures are made. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In deterministic comparisons of breeding schemes it is necessary to take account of variance reduction due to selection. This can take place as multi-stage selection within generations and it-takes place across generations when offspring of selected parents are selected. A standard way to deal with this is to set up selection index equations where the parameters are altered as a consequence of selection. It is shown that if the breeding schemes use a univariate or multivariate best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) animal model for prediction of breeding values this procedure can be simplified. This is done by modelling the distribution of estimated breeding value (EBV) utilizing that changes in EBV of an individual are independent of selection. In the univariate case the variance reduction and the resulting genetic gain can be calculated from the selection intensities and the accuracies in the unselected population. An expression is given for the response in each generation when selection is started in a base population with complete pedigree. This shows that a limiting value is obtained within three to four generations. The asymptotic response for several traits is described in the case where selection is on multitrait BLUP.

The sub indices are designed to increase the profitability of different specific components of the beef industry. Secondly some initial results of a project that has begun, aiming to further optimize these developments, are presented. This project will focus on several issues including trait definition, modeling of breed effects in Irish data sets and determining appropriate fixed and random effects in a multibreed scenario. Initial heritabilities for carcase weight, carcase fat and carcase conformation as a function of age, using data gathered routinely in abattoirs, are presented. The data set was multibreed in nature. Fixed regressions on breed fractions were used to model breed effects. Carcase conformation for younger animals tended to have moderate to high heritabilities (0.32-0.50), while carcase fatness and carcase weight heritabilities for the same age range were slightly lower (0.23-0.39).},

Proportion of retail cuts affected by price discounts was included in the calculations. Optimizing endpoints did not affect rankings to any extent relative to a fixed end point in this sample of bulls, as a result of fixed endpoints being similar to optimized endpoints for the economic situation considered. However, rank correlations were only 0.63 and 0.71 between rankings for no discount being applied and rankings with discounts for intramuscular fat and LM area, for fixed and optimized endpoints, respectively.

abstract = {Current genetic evaluations are performed separately for each breed. Multiple breed genetic evaluations, however, assume a common base among breeds, enabling producers to compare cattle of different breed makeup. Breed and heterosis effects are needed in a multibreed evaluation because databases maintained by breed associations include few crossbred animals, which may not be enough to accurately estimate these effects. The objective of this study was to infer breed effects, maternal effects, direct heterosis effects, and maternal heterosis effects for growth and carcass traits using least squares means estimates from crossbreeding studies published in the literature from 1976 to 1996. The data set was formed by recording each least squares mean along with the breed composition, maternal breed composition, and direct and maternal heterozygosity. Each trait was analyzed using a single trait fixed effect model, which included study as a fixed effect and breed composition and heterozygosity as covariates. Breed solutions for each trait were expressed relative to the Angus breed. Direct breed effects for weaning weight ranged from -7.0 +/- 0.67 kg (British Dairy) to 29.3 +/- 0.74 kg (Simmental), and maternal effects ranged from -11.7 +/- 0.24 kg (Hereford) to 31.1 +/- 2.22 kg (Gelbvieh). Direct breed effects for birth weight ranged from -0.5 +/- 0.14 kg (British Dairy) to 10.1 +/- 0.46 kg (Continental Beef), and maternal effects ranged from -7.2 +/- 0.13 kg (Brahman) to 6.0 +/- 1.07 kg (Continental Beef). Direct breed effects ranged from -17.9 +/- 1.64 kg (Brahman) to 21.6 +/- 1.95 kg (Charolais), from -6.5 +/- 1.29 kg (Brahman) to 55.8 +/- 1.47 kg (Continental Beef), from -8.1 +/- 0.48 cm(2) (Shorthorn) to 21.0 +/- 0.48 cm(2) (Continental Beef), and from -1.1 +/- 0.02 cm (Continental Beef) to 0 +/- 0.00 cm (Angus) for postweaning BW gain, carcass weight, LM area, and fat thickness, respectively. The use of literature estimates to predict direct and maternal breed and heterosis effects may supplement their direct prediction in a multibreed evaluation.},

abstract = {This study investigates the feasibility to predict individual methane (CH 4 ) emissions from dairy cows using milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra. To have a large variability of milk composition, two experiments were conducted on 11 lactating Holstein cows (two primiparous and nine multiparous). The first experiment aimed to induce a large variation in CH 4 emission by feeding two different diets: the first one was mainly composed of fresh grass and sugar beet pulp and the second one of maize silage and hay. The second experiment consisted of grass and corn silage with cracked corn, soybean meal and dried pulp. For each milking period, the milk yields were recorded twice daily and a milk sample of 50 ml was collected from each cow and analyzed by MIR spectrometry. Individual CH 4 emissions were measured daily using the sulfur hexafluoride method during a 7-day period. CH 4 daily emissions ranged from 10.2 to 47.1 g CH 4 /kg of milk. The spectral data were transformed to represent an average daily milk spectrum (AMS), which was related to the recorded daily CH 4 data. By assuming a delay before the production of fermentation products in the rumen and their use to produce milk components, five different calculations were used: AMS at days 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 compared with the CH 4 measurement. The equations were built using Partial Least Squares regression. From the calculated R 2 cv , it appears that the accuracy of CH 4 prediction by MIR changed in function of the milking days. In our experimental conditions, the AMS at day 1.5 compared with the measure of CH 4 emissions gave the best results. The R 2 and s.e. of the cross-validation were equal to 0.79 and 5.14 g of CH 4 /kg of milk. The multiple correlation analysis performed in this study showed the existence of a close relationship between milk fatty acid (FA) profile and CH 4 emission at day 1.5. The lower R 2 ( R 2 = 0.76) obtained between FA profile and CH 4 emission compared with the one corresponding to the obtained calibration ( R 2 c = 0.87) shows the interest to apply directly the developed CH 4 equation instead of the use of correlations between FA and CH 4 . In conclusion, our preliminary results suggest the feasibility of direct CH 4 prediction from milk MIR spectra. Additional research has the potential to improve the calibrations even further. This alternative method could be useful to predict the individual CH 4 emissions at farm level or at the regional scale and it also could be used to identify low-CH 4 -emitting cows.},

abstract = {The reduction of greenhouse gases is an issue of worldwide importance. Starting out from this fact, the paper aims to describe the processes determining methane production (CH4) in the keeping of farm animals. The CH4 emissions are calculated for different forms of the production of ruminants for edible protein of animal origin. Milk protein can be produced with considerably fewer methane emissions than the meat protein of cattle. At the same time, it can be shown that the methane emissions are generally higher at a higher production level of the ruminants, but decrease per unit of produced product. With increasing production levels, these effects decrease continuously. Under consideration of the calculated methane emissions, the increase of the animal performance and a possible reduction of the number of ruminants should currently be the most effective measure for obtaining a decrease of methane emissions at short notice. Animal health, lower animal losses, long periods of productive life of cows and short growing period of heifers are further possibilities to reduce the methane emissions by ruminants. Continuing research is necessary to achieve practicable and reproducible results with other reduction possibilities. Further examinations are intended to investigate the complex interactions between the animal food production and the saving of resources (ground, water, fuel, fertilizer effort, transportation expense, etc.) with regard to energy use and ecological dam- 464 G.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Dairy Science Association. This study aimed to evaluate whether the host genotype exerts any genetic control on the microbiome composition of the rumen in cattle. Microbial DNA was extracted from 18 samples of ruminal content from 2 breeds (Holstein and Brown Swiss). Reads were processed using mothur (https://www.mothur.org/) in 16S and 18S rRNA gene-based analyses. Then, reads were classified at the genus clade, resulting in 3,579 operational taxonomic units (OTU) aligned against the 16S database and 184 OTU aligned against the 18S database. After filtering on relative abundance (  0.1{\%}) and penetrance (95{\%}), 25 OTU were selected for the analyses (17 bacteria, 1 archaea, and 7 ciliates). Association with the genetic background of the host animal based on the principal components of a genomic relationship matrix based on single nucleotide polymorphism markers was analyzed using Bayesian methods. Fifty percent of the bacteria and archaea genera were associated with the host genetic background, including Butyrivibrio, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, and Methanobrevibacter as main genera. Forty-three percent of the ciliates analyzed were also associated with the genetic background of the host. In total, 48{\%} of microbes were associated with the host genetic background. The results in this study support the hypothesis and provide some evidence that there exists a host genetic component in cattle that can partially regulate the composition of the microbiome.},

abstract = {This review synthesizes a range of research findings regarding behavioral and production responses to health disorders and subsequent illness detection for herds using automatic (robotic) milking systems (AMS). We discuss the effects of health disorders on cow behavior and production, specifically those variables that are routinely recorded by AMS and associated technologies. This information is used to inform the resultant use of behavior and production variables and to summarize and critique current illness detection studies. For conventional and AMS herds separately, we examined research from the past 20 yr and those variables recorded automatically on-farm that may respond to development of illness and lameness. The main variables identified were milk yield, rumination time, activity, and body weight, in addition to frequency of successful, refused, and fetched (involuntary) milkings in AMS herds. Whether making comparisons within cow or between sick and healthy cows, consistent reductions in activity, rumination time, and milk yield are observed. Lameness, however, had obvious negative effects on milk yield but not necessarily on rumination time or activity. Finally, we discuss detection models for identifying lameness and other health disorders using routinely collected data in AMS, specifically focusing on their scientific validation and any study limitations that create a need for further research. Of the current studies that have worked toward disease detection, many data have been excluded or separated for isolated models (i.e., fresh cows, certain lactation groups, and cows with multiple illnesses or moderate cases). Thus, future studies should (1) incorporate the entire lactating herd while accounting for stage of lactation and parity of each animal; (2) evaluate the deviations that cows exhibit from their own baseline trajectories and relative to healthy contemporaries; (3) combine the use of several variables into health alerts; and (4) differentiate the probable type of health disorder. Most importantly, no model or software currently exists to integrate data and directly support decision-making, which requires further research to bridge the gap between technology and herd health management.},

These changes were closely related to the increase in mechanical strength of the intramuscular connective tissue and resulted in a toughening of the beef during the period. The shear force value of longissimus muscle decreased after 20 mo of age, concomitantly with the rapid increase in the crude fat content. Scanning electron micrographs of the longissimus muscle dissected from 32-mo-old steers clearly showed that the adipose tissues were formed between muscle fiber bundles, that the honeycomb structure of endomysia was partially broken, and that the perimysium separated into thinner collagen fibers. In semitendinosus muscle, in which the crude fat content was lower (P{\textless}.05) than that in longissimus muscle, the structure of the intramuscular connective tissue remained rigid at 32 mo of age. The shear force value of the muscle increased even in the late fattening period, from 20 to 32 mo of age. Thus, the development of adipose tissues in longissimus muscle appears to disorganize the structure of the intramuscular connective tissue and contributes to tenderization of highly marbled beef from Japanese Black cattle during the late fattening period.},

abstract = {This paper presents a procedure for the development of a breeding objective for a beef cattle breed used in a range of production systems. The five main beef cattle production systems in France were first described and then equations of income and costs as a function of the 25 biological traits to be genetically improved for breeding and production were established. Economic values for individual systems were defined as the first derivative of the herd profit with respect to these 25 traits while the economic values for the overall breeding objective were taken as the average of economic values over the five production systems. An application is presented for the Limousin breed. Sensitivity of the breeding objective to variation in the economic or demographic context was also studied. Breeding traits, especially maternal effects on weaning weight and calving success, were identified as the most economically important traits requiring improvement. Relative economic values were very robust with respect to variations in system frequencies and replacement rates. A dramatic change in the market price for beef (-50{\%}) increased the relative weighting of carcass quality traits to the detriment of breeding traits although a smaller change in beef price (-25{\%}) had no significant effect on the relative economic values. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The present study aimed to quantify the contribution of herd environment to beef carcass characteristics (weight, conformation score and fat score) with particular emphasis on generating finishing herd-specific profiles for these traits across different ages at slaughter. Abattoir records from 46,115 heifers and 78,790 steers aged between 360 and 900 days, and from 22,971 young bulls aged between 360 and 720 days, were analysed. Finishing herd-year and animal genetic (co)variance components for each trait were estimated using random regression models. Across slaughter age and gender, the ratio of finishing herd-year to total phenotypic variance ranged from 0.31 to 0.72 for carcass weight, 0.21 to 0.57 for carcass conformation and 0.11 to 0.44 for carcass fat score. These parameters indicate that the finishing herd environment is an important contributor to carcass trait variability and amenable to improvement with management practices.},

abstract = {SummaryThe goal of animal breeding is to improve performance traits of animal populations through selection. The selection criterion is usually based on best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of additive genetic effects. BLUP requires knowledge about variance components that have to be estimated in practice. Due to its desirable properties restricted maximum likelihood (REML) has become the method of choice for the estimation of variance components of mixed linear models in animal breeding. Impressive progress has been made in the development of efficient computing algorithms that allow REML to be used for general mixed linear models of large data sets. Various flexible computer programs have become available. Due to the adoption of Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures Bayesian estimation has recently become feasible and is increasingly used in animal breeding applications. The availability of powerful computers and advances in the efficiency of computing algorithms allow the consideration of increasingly complex models. Therefore, the development and application of appropriate statistical procedures for model comparison is becoming more important.ZusammenfassungVarianzkomponentensch{\"{a}}tzung in der Tierzucht-eine UebersichtDas Ziel der Tierzucht ist die Verbesserung der Leistung von Tierapopulationen durch Selektion.

abstract = {Young stock survival is an important trait as calf mortality leads to economic losses. Furthermore, dead calves are an animal welfare issue. The aim of this Master's thesis was to estimate genetic parameters for young stock survival, in order to evaluate if it is feasible to implement young stock survival in the Nordic routine genetic evaluation for beef x dairy crossbred calves. Data on 101,172 crossbred calves was provided by SEGES. Two traits were defined, young stock survival from 1-30 days and 31-200 days after birth. The traits were analyzed with a univariate animal model using the AI-REML algorithm in the DMU package. Results showed low but significant heritabilities (0.045-0.075) for both survival traits in line with previous studies. Breed combinations with Danish Blue cattle sires outperformed all other sire breeds. The lowest survival rates were found for breed combinations with Jersey dams or Blonde d'Aquitaine sires. Breeding values were calculated using DMU4 and sufficient genetic variation for young stock survival was found. Differences in breeding values ranged from -2.5 to 3.5 {\%} and -5.4 to 4.7 {\%} for survival from 1-30 days and 31-200 respectively. It is therefore feasible to implement young stock survival in the genetic evaluation for beef x dairy crossbred calves. This will increase the survival rate of the calves and hereby increase animal welfare and decrease economic loss for the veal producers.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate parameters required for genetic evaluation of Simmental carcass merit using carcass and live animal data. Carcass weight, fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, and marbling score were available from 5,750 steers and 1,504 heifers sired by Simmental bulls. Additionally, yearling ultrasound measurements of fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, and estimated percentage of intramuscular fat were available on Simmental bulls (n = 3,409) and heifers (n = 1,503). An extended pedigree was used to construct the relationship matrix (n = 23,968) linking bulls and heifers with ultrasound data to steers and heifers with carcass data. All data were obtained from the American Simmental Association. No animal had both ultrasound and carcass data. Using an animal model and treating corresponding ultrasound and carcass traits separately, genetic parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Heritability estimates for carcass traits were 0.48 +/- 0.06, 0.35 +/- 0.05, 0.46 +/- 0.05, and 0.54 +/- 0.05 for carcass weight, fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, and marbling score, respectively. Heritability estimates for bull (heifer) ultrasound traits were 0.53 +/- 0.07 (0.69 +/- 0.09), 0.37 +/- 0.06 (0.51 +/- 0.09), and 0.47 +/- 0.06 (0.52 +/- 0.09) for fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, and intramuscular fat percentage, respectively. Heritability of weight at scan was 0.47 +/- 0.05. Using a bivariate weight model including scan weight of bulls and heifers with carcass weight of slaughter animals, a genetic correlation of 0.77 +/- 0.10 was obtained. Models for fat thickness, longissimus muscle area, and marbling score were each trivariate, including ultrasound measurements on yearling bulls and heifers, and corresponding carcass traits of slaughter animals. Genetic correlations of carcass fat thickness with bull and heifer ultrasound fat were 0.79 +/- 0.13 and 0.83 +/- 0.12, respectively. Genetic correlations of carcass longissimus muscle area with bull and heifer ultrasound longissimus muscle area were 0.80 +/- 0.11 and 0.54 +/- 0.12, respectively. Genetic correlations of carcass marbling score with bull and heifer ultrasound intramuscular fat percentage were 0.74 +/- 0.11 and 0.69 +/- 0.13, respectively. These results provide the parameter estimates necessary for genetic evaluation of Simmental carcass merit using both data from steer and heifer carcasses, and their ultrasound indicators on yearling bulls and heifers.},

abstract = {Data collected from an experimental Holstein-Friesian research herd were used to determine genetic and phenotypic parameters of innate and adaptive cellular immune-associated traits. Relationships between immune-associated traits and production, health, and fertility traits were also investigated. Repeated blood leukocyte records were analyzed in 546 cows for 9 cellular immune-associated traits, including percent T cell subsets, B cells, NK cells, and granulocytes. Variance components were estimated by univariate analysis. Heritability estimates were obtained for all 9 traits, the highest of which were observed in the T cell subsets percent CD4+, percent CD8+, CD4+:CD8+ ratio, and percent NKp46+ cells (0.46, 0.41, 0.43 and 0.42, respectively), with between-individual variation accounting for 59 to 81{\%} of total phenotypic variance. Associations between immune-associated traits and production, health, and fertility traits were investigated with bivariate analyses. Strong genetic correlations were observed between percent NKp46+ and stillbirth rate (0.61), and lameness episodes and percent CD8+ (−0.51). Regarding production traits, the strongest relationships were between CD4+:CD8+ ratio and weight phenotypes (−0.52 for live weight; −0.51 for empty body weight). Associations between feed conversion traits and immune-associated traits were also observed. Our results provide evidence that cellular immune-associated traits are heritable and repeatable, and the noticeable variation between animals would permit selection for altered trait values, particularly in the case of the T cell subsets. The associations we observed between immune-associated, health, fertility, and production traits suggest that genetic selection for cellular immune-associated traits could provide a useful tool in improving animal health, fitness, and fertility.},

abstract = {In many areas of animal behaviour research, improvements in our ability to collect large and detailed data sets are outstripping our ability to analyse them. These diverse, complex and often high-dimensional data sets exhibit nonlinear dependencies and unknown interactions across multiple variables, and may fail to conform to the assumptions of many classical statistical methods. The field of machine learning provides methodologies that are ideally suited to the task of extracting knowledge from these data. In this review, we aim to introduce animal behaviourists unfamiliar with machine learning (ML) to the promise of these techniques for the analysis of complex behavioural data. We start by describing the rationale behind ML and review a number of animal behaviour studies where ML has been successfully deployed. The ML framework is then introduced by presenting several unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Following this overview, we illustrate key ML approaches by developing data analytical pipelines for three different case studies that exemplify the types of behavioural and ecological questions ML can address. The first uses a large number of spectral and morphological characteristics that describe the appearance of pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs to assign them to putative clutches. The second takes a continuous data stream of feeder visits from PIT (passive integrated transponder)-tagged jackdaws, Corvus monedula, and extracts foraging events from it, which permits the construction of social networks. Our final example uses aerial images to train a classifier that detects the presence of wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, to count individuals in a population. With the advent of cheaper sensing and tracking technologies an unprecedented amount of data on animal behaviour is becoming available. We believe that ML will play a central role in translating these data into scientific knowledge and become a useful addition to the animal behaviourist's analytical toolkit.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic prediction of breeding values involves a so-called training analysis that predicts the influence of small genomic regions by regression of observed information on marker genotypes for a given population of individuals. Available observations may take the form of individual phenotypes, repeated observations, records on close family members such as progeny, estimated breeding values (EBV) or their deregressed counterparts from genetic evaluations. The literature indicates that researchers are inconsistent in their approach to using EBV or deregressed data, and as to using the appropriate methods for weighting some data sources to account for heterogeneous variance. METHODS: A logical approach to using information for genomic prediction is introduced, which demonstrates the appropriate weights for analyzing observations with heterogeneous variance and explains the need for and the manner in which EBV should have parent average effects removed, be deregressed and weighted. RESULTS: An appropriate deregression for genomic regression analyses is EBV/r2 where EBV excludes parent information and r2 is the reliability of that EBV. The appropriate weights for deregressed breeding values are neither the reliability nor the prediction error variance, two alternatives that have been used in published studies, but the ratio (1 - h2)/[(c + (1 - r2)/r2)h2] where c {\textgreater} 0 is the fraction of genetic variance not explained by markers. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic information on some individuals and deregressed data on others can be combined in genomic analyses using appropriate weighting.},
