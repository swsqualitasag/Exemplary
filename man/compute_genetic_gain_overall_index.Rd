\item{proportion_calves}{Proportion of calves in the offspring.}

\item{proportion_adults}{Proportion of adults in the offspring.}

\item{male_proportionselected}{Proportion selected of the offspring of a male selection candidate}

\item{female_proportionselected}{Proportion selected of the offspring of a female selection candidate}

\item{male_generationintervall}{Generation intervall of the male selection path.}

\item{female_generationintervall}{Generation intervall of the female selection path.}

\item{economic_weights}{A vector of economic weights with lenght of number of traits.}

\value{
Genetic Gain in Sfr. per year
}
\description{
This function computes the genetic gain in Sfr. / year of the selection on the index. In this index all traits are represented in the aggregate genotype.
